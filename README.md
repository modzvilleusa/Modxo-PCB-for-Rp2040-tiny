This is a custom adapter PCB for the Modxo Rp2040 project from Shalxmva to use an off the shelf rp2040-tiny.

Please note that this project is fairly early in development. Pinouts may change down the line and more features are being added that will likely require additional hardware. 
I will update these pcbs as the project develops.
